## Foreword
I (unfortunately) was not able to get both of the wtforms fields' data to get recognized under one unified submit button press.
Therefore I have left two submit buttons in my program + screenshots.
I undersand that this will likely negatively affect my grade because I have not accomplished exactly what was stated on the lab assignment.
## Screenshots
### Activity 4 Step 2
My screenshot for activity 4 step 2 can be found at screenshots/ECE444Lab2Activity4-2.png. It has an extra submit button on the webpage.
### Activity 4 Step 3
My screenshot for activity 4 step 3 can be found at screenshots/ECE444Lab2Activity4-3.png. It has an extra submit button on the webpage.
### Activity 4 Step 4
My screenshot for activity 4 step 4 can be found at screenshots/ECE444Lab2Activity4-4.png. It has an extra submit button on the webpage. As a result of the extra submit button, the "What is your name?" field contents are not being preserved like they are in the example in the lab assignment. Furthermore, the warning for not having an "@" sign in the email address does not actively recognize the data entered in that field. It instead states "... 'email_address' is missing a '@'".
### Activity 4 Step 5
My screenshot for activity 4 step 5 can be found at screenshots/ECE444Lab2Activity4-5.png. It has an extra submit button on the webpage. As a result of the extra submit button, the "Looks like you have changed your name" indication is not present in my screenshot.
